			<p>Hailing from a small town in Ohio, Sukhjit got his comedic start where he's currently living and performing; Columbus, Ohio. With close to a year and a half under his belt, he's opened for nationally touring comedians, such as Dan Mintz, and was a finalist in the Columbus's Funniest Competition. His cheerful story-telling and silly narratives about snakes and his Indian upbringing in rural Ohio have been mildly refreshing and quite pleasant for audiences in clubs across the country. You don't want to miss this guy!</p>
